Currency Converter
---
I have just build a basic tool to convert the currency from one to another.I have used HTML,CSS,JS.
By using a free API that available on internet. By fetch() API concept in JS i used to make my tool to give answer perfetcly by fetching the data and giving a response,doing this gave me a much confidence on the concepts of JS like DOM,fetch API,functions,and main concepts of JS.
